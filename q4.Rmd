In this problem, we are going to analysis some data (Superhero.dat) relating to childrenâ€™s injuries while wearing superhero costumes. Children reporting to the emergency center at hospitals had the severity of their injury (injury) assessed (on a scale from 0, no injury, to 100, death). In addition, a note was taken of which superhero costume they were wearing (hero): Spiderman (1), Superman (2), the Hulk (3) or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (4).

(a) Read the data `superhero.dat` by using `read_tsv` from `tidyverse`.
q4data <- read_tsv('superhero.dat')

(b) Recode the costume labels and make the variable a "factor".
q4data$hero[q4data$hero==1] <- 'x1'
q4data$hero[q4data$hero==2] <- 'x2'
q4data$hero[q4data$hero==3] <- 'x3'
q4data$hero[q4data$hero==4] <- 'x4'


(c) Run a linear regression model to predict level of injury.
injury = 41.62 + 18.71(Superman) - 6.25(Hulk) - 15.37(TMNT)

(d) Draw some boxplots to show the injury severity for each superhero costumes.
boxplot(injury~hero, data = q4data)
